      <div id="introduction">

     <p>Experience Fredrikstad from a truly unique perspective! This guided bicycle tour
     will take you to some of the city's most beautiful, yet fairly unkown locations,
     cycling through the canal passage, experience the old town, travel through through
     its forest and find out about the history of the locations spreading as far back as to
      the 8th century!</p>

      <p>This section tour will not only let you discover the most unique traits of Fredrikstad,
      but we will also be venutring in the neighbourhood city Sarpsborg, due to that the 2 cities
      are so connected to each other. We'll be traveling in the day, and once we're finished with
      the tour, we'll have fun in the city in the evening.</p>

  <p class="info_text">Fredrikstad is the largest city in the county Østfold. It is a beautiful city with a lot of options.
     Visit the cinema, museum, festivals, arrangements, the pubs, and the parks. Fredrikstad is a beautiful multicultural city
     architected with tall buildings, long streets, and an even-toned color used infrastructure.</p>

  <p class="info_text">The Old Town is Northern Europe's best-preserved fortified city.
    When you get off the Fredrikstad side you are literally on Glommastien.
    Follow Glommastien up along the river past Lisleby.
    Here you will cycle through both the inhabited area and the terrain area along Glomma - follow the markings.
    Glommastien leads you further towards Greåker.
    The road continues on the county road 557 until Alvim passing through Sandesundbrua. The Old Town will
    be a place we're going to eat, explore and relax at for a while</p>

  <p class="info_text">
  The Glomma Road is 35 km long and is marked with "Glommastien" on high piles and signs. Glommastien starts
  at Old Town and follows the walk / cycle path down Hafslund Hovedgård and back again to the R111 towards Årum / Fredrikstad.
  It is particulalry beautiful to travel there seeing its lake and listening to the birds in the forst.
  Brining along a fishing rod is not a bad idea as there are plenty of good fish in the lake.
