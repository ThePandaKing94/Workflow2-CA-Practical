Regarding the minifying of images I'm not sure. I've never done it before because I misunderstood on last assignment and it seems that my code and test command works fine, and it
is minifying the images, there are just 0 images minifed. So I'm not sure why this is. Maybe it's because I used FastStone Photo Resizer on my images last year?
